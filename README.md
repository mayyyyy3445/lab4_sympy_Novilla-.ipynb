1.  x + x
This adds the variable x to itself. In algebra, this simplifies to 2x. SymPy recognizes that and outputs 2*x.

2. x * x
This means multiplying x by itself, which is x². In Python, it's written as x**2.

3. limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)
This calculates the mathematical limit of the expression 
sin
⁡
(
x
)
x
x
sin(x)

  as x approaches 0. The result is 1. It's a common and important limit in calculus that shows how functions behave near a specific point.

4. diff(x**2, x)
This computes the derivative of 
x
2
x 
2
  with respect to x. The result is 2x. A derivative represents the rate of change or the slope of a curve. So, this tells you the slope of the curve increases as x increases.

6. solve(Eq(x**2 - 4, 0), x)
This solves the equation 
x
2
−

x 
2
 −4=0. The solutions are x = -2 and x = 2. These are the values that make the equation true. It's an example of solving a quadratic equation.

7. Type of problem
The equation in step 6 is a quadratic equation because it involves 
x
2
x 
2
 . Quadratics often have two solutions.
